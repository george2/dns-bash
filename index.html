<p>These are just a few DNS-related bash scripts I use to create a custom hosts file, among other things. They can be thought of in two ways: either as a set of DNS-backup scripts for the paranoid, or a way to significantly speed up browsing performance. </p>

<p>Hint: These were created when <a href="http://sopastrike.com/strike/">SOPA</a> was under consideration. </p>

<a name="how-to-use-the-scripts" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use-the-scripts"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use the scripts</h1>

<pre><code>addomains duckduckgo.com github.com www.example.com
# These are all the sites I want to have in my hosts file
# You can also just edit the 'domains' file manually, 
#  see domains.example for format.
optdomains
# This will make the domains file smaller and more efficient.
# It is optional, but recommended.
makedomains
# This is where the important stuff happens.
sudo cp hosts /etc/hosts
# If you're going to use this as your hosts file, install it in etc.
</code></pre>

<p>You can also leave the generated hosts file in the working dir, and use the other scripts (<code>domgrep</code>, <code>domlookup</code>, <code>ldig</code>) to do random stuff with domains and their IPs. </p>

<p>If you want to brute-force the internet, run <code>findomains</code>, wait a few hundred years until it finishes, then look in disappointment at the small portion of the internet for which you now have an already-out-of-date list of IPs and domains. Have fun with that.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to test your setup to see what it would be like to live without dns, just run <code>dnsinkhole</code> as root. Press <code>Ctrl-D</code> or <code>Ctrl-C</code> to stop the sinkhole.</p>
